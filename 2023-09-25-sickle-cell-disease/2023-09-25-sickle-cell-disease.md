**The Potential of AI in Sickle Cell Disease**

**Introduction**

Sickle cell disease, including sickle cell anemia, affects millions of
people worldwide, with a disproportionate impact on individuals of black
African or black Caribbean backgrounds. This genetic disorder can have
lifelong health implications, ranging from increased susceptibility to
infections and stroke to anemia and excruciating pain crises.

While strides have been made to improve the quality of life for those
with sickle cell disease, research efforts remain significantly
underfunded.

As we observe Sickle Cell Awareness Month, let's explore how artificial
intelligence (AI) is playing a pivotal role in transforming the
diagnosis, treatment, and management of this condition, offering new
hope to those affected.

**What is sickle cell disease?**

Before we dive into AI-driven advancements, let's quickly
touch on exactly what [sickle cell
disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876)
is.

In individuals with this condition, red blood cells take on an atypical
shape due to a genetic mutation, resembling sickles rather than the
typical biconcave disks. These abnormal cells can clump together,
impeding their movement through the bloodstream and potentially blocking
blood vessels leading to infections, stroke, anemia, and episodes of
intense pain known as sickle cell crises.

‍

While some carriers of the genetic trait may remain free of symptoms,
for others, it's a lifelong battle. Around [300 million people
worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537130/) carry the
sickle cell mutation, and [over 7 million suffer from the disease
itself](<https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhae/article/PIIS2352-3026(23)00118-7/fulltext>).

**Is there a cure?**

The only known cure for sickle cell disease is a [bone marrow
transplant](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sickle-cell-disease/treatment#:~:text=A%20blood%20and%20bone%20marrow,match%20to%20be%20a%20donor.).
But it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Not everyone
with sickle cell disease has a relative who is a close enough genetic
match to be a donor. And the treatment tends to be most effective in
children and poses significantly greater risks for adults.

Fortunately, there are ways to alleviate symptoms, such as
pharmaceutical treatments and blood transfusions. Nevertheless, managing
the lifelong condition requires complex, evolving treatments and
frequent medical interventions.

**How AI can help**

**Early Diagnosis with AI.**

One of the major hurdles in treating sickle cell disease is early
diagnosis. AI is helping here by analyzing medical records, genetic
data, and clinical symptoms to identify individuals at risk. Machine
learning algorithms can detect patterns and predict the [likelihood of a
patient developing related
conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37355428/), such as sickle
cell anemia and [sickle cell
retinopathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452674/),
allowing for timely interventions.

**Personalized Treatment Plans.**

Recognizing that no two individuals with sickle cell anemia are
identical, AI systems monitor a patient's health over time and craft
personalized treatment plans. These plans can include optimizing
[medication dosages based on pain
levels](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2271074-ai-helps-assess-pain-levels-in-people-with-sickle-cell-disease/)
and scheduling proactive follow-up appointments.

**Remote Patient Monitoring.**

AI-driven wearable devices are revolutionizing patient care. These
devices continuously collect data on a patient's vital signs, such as
heart rate, oxygen levels, and pain indicators. In the UK, the [National
Health Service has launched a
scheme](https://www.lnwh.nhs.uk/news/ai-employed-to-help-fight-sickle-cell-disease-8570/)
to track those with sickle cell disease with a smartwatch.

AI algorithms examine this data and can notify healthcare providers of
concerning trends, enabling timely interventions and enhancing clinical
research.

**Case study: AI assesses pain levels in people with sickle cell
disease**

In 2021, Dr Daniel Abrams at Northwestern University and his team
[developed an AI tool to objectively assess the pain
levels](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008542)
of individuals with sickle cell disease using commonly taken vital
signs.

Pain's subjective nature makes standardized measurement challenging,
prompting Abrams to explore whether routinely collected physiological
data like body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure could
objectively assess pain.

Their study involved 46 patients with sickle cell disease during 105
hospital stays. By combining physiological data with patient-reported
pain scores and employing machine learning, they developed models
capable of deducing pain levels and detecting changes. Comparing these
models to existing ones that rely solely on patient-reported data, the
new models exhibited superior performance, potentially offering a more
quantitative approach to pain management.

In the future, the technique could be used to help doctors prescribe
better dosages of pain medication for those suffering from sickle cell
disease. The innovation also has significant potential elsewhere
including in pediatric care, where children often struggle to articulate
their pain.

The team's goal is to compile extensive data from millions
of hospitalizations, encompassing various pain conditions, including
post-operative and chronic pain, paving the way for more effective pain
management practices.

**What does the future hold?**

AI- and ML-powered technologies are potential game changers in the fight
against sickle cell disease, redefining patient care. However,
it.s crucial to acknowledge a significant hurdle the field
faces: there is not enough research and not enough funding. Sickle cell
disease has long been overlooked in research, despite being one of the
most common genetic disorders globally.

That's why advocacy efforts and increased awareness are
essential to mobilize funding and research interest, ensuring that AI
and other cutting edge technologies can fully realize their potential in
advancing sickle cell disease treatment.

As technology continues to advance, we look forward to even more
innovative applications of AI in the field of healthcare, ultimately
improving the lives of individuals affected by sickle cell disease.
