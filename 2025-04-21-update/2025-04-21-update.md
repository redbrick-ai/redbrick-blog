# RedBrick AI Spring 2025 Product Updates

Over the past few months, we've rolled out a series of updates focused on precision and polishâ€”bringing new capabilities to your workflows while squashing bugs and improving performance behind the scenes.

**Here's what's new:**

### Powerful New Analytics & Filter Controls

Analytics 2.0 is here! Apply advanced filters by Object Label, Classification, submission dates, Stage, and more - (and all filters are now persist as you navigate around the RedBrick Dashboard).

Task Analytics for Consensus Projects now show the most recent label version, improving clarity and tracking.

### Platform Upgrades & QoL Improvements

Projects & Workspaces Archiving - easily archive and unarchive to declutter your Home Page sidebar without losing data!

Taxonomy JSON Import/Export - fetching your Taxonomy in nice, clean JSON is now achievable with a single click! Similarly, you can now upload a Taxonomy directly inside the GUI - no more fussing about with API keys!

Editable Attribute Options - fine-tune Select and Multiselect fields directly in the UI without having to delete and re-create them.

Boost Auto-start - Boost instances now spin up automatically when needed. Visual indicators also show when a Boost instance has resumed, keeping teams aware of compute actions.

Boost can also be configured to work with your model (yes, you read that right)!

### Workflow Enhancements

Multiple Organizations - Org Owners can now manage multiple Orgs under one account for better oversight and team control.

URL Filters on the Data Page - share precise data views and search queries with a link.

Improved Comments & Layout - UX tweaks across the Editor, including better sidebar behavior, comment replies, and Classification clarity for Consensus_Merge Projects.

### SDK Power for Developers

Manage your workforce, data points, and storage methods with expanded SDK functionality.

Preview Storage Methods directly from the Preview Tool.

### Fixes & Polish

Squashed bugs related to Cuboid rendering, some visual inconsistencies, and a pesky pseudo-cursor.

Also included: performance upgrades and a new Help Button benchmark test to keep your experience smooth.

### Removed
