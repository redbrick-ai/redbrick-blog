## What this feature is

This tool allows you to iteratively "scribble" on a structure with a paint brush. Based on these scribbles our model will generate a 3D segmentation of the targeted structure. You can run this process iteratively to refine your segmentations.

This is our most powerful segmentation tool yet and we can't wait for the medical imaging industry to try it.

## RedBrick AI Boost

RedBrick AI Boost is our modular server for allowing RedBrick AI customers access to the latest in AI assisted annotation and AI in the loop features, all while maintaining privacy and compliance. Activating Boost unlocks the following features and capabilities:

- F.A.S.T.: 2D and "2.5D" segmentation with just a quick bounding box
- Mask Propogation: Intelligent 3D propagation of any segmentation to fully segment a 3D structure
- Access to 14 different pre trained models for presegmentation of data on upload
- Bring your own model: Upload your dockerized annotation model to Boost and whenever you upload new tasks to a RedBrick AI project we'll run your model and pre annotate the images.

## How to try this

Existing customers can write to support@redbrickai.com to request access to the F.A.S.T. Brush tool.
