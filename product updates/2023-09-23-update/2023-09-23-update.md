# Quick image and segmentation visualization with Preview Mode!

Hi all!  
  
Introducing: Preview Mode. With Preview Mode, you can quickly visualize images and segmentations, to model results! Instead of downloading and running local tools such as 3D Slicer for quick visualization, give RedBrick's Preview Mode a try!

We built the feature with the following primary use cases in mind. Let us know what you think!

# Quickly Visualize Model Predictions

We’ve heard from ML engineers that they usually visualize model predictions in Jupyter Notebook by plotting the image superimposed with the segmentations. We’ve also heard that teams use tools such as 3D Slicer to visualize their segmentations.

You can now use Preview Mode to audit your model’s segmentation predictions in a snap! Just drag and drop your image & prediction into the Preview Mode viewer, and you're ready to go!

# Instant Image Visualization

Creating a Project on RedBrick AI or firing up a locally installed tool to visualize any DICOM series or study can be annoying, or, worse - time-consuming. Preview Mode allows you to easily view any image, DICOM, NIfTI, NRRD, etc., in the browser in just a few clicks!
