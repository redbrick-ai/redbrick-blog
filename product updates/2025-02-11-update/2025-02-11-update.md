# RedBrick AI Q4 2024 Product Updates

## Consensus 3.0

Our multi-reader flows are essential to vast number of teams that use the RedBrick platform. And we spent a good amount of time and effort reflecting upon your feedback and re-imagining the (then) current MO, and ideating on gaps to be filled.

The result is Consensus 3.0, which retains all of the old project formats that RedBrick veterans know and love, while introducing something entirely new: [Manual Merge](https://docs.redbrickai.com/project-pages/multiple-labeling/consensus#manual-merge-projects), or “build your own Ground Truth”.

There have been some slight changes to naming conventions and improvements to flows. For example, all Consensus Projects now have to have a Review Stage. But, as always, these changes are iterative!

We encourage team leads and project managers to try out both the Best Annotator and Manual Merge review flows to develop a sense of which one makes the most sense for their projects.

## Boost

For a long time, RedBrick [Boost](https://docs.redbrickai.com/dashboard/boost) was a powerful, multi-functional tool that had not quite received permission to reach exit velocity. That all changed in Q1 2025, and now we’re burning out our fuse up here alone!

Boost has solidified into a true game-changer. It is an engine that gives you access to RedBrick’s most powerful AI-assisted segmentation tools (such as F.A.S.T. and Mask Propagation) and the entirety of our [Auto Annotator](https://docs.redbrickai.com/dashboard/boost/auto-annotator) (previously “CT Segmentator”) libraries, pre-Stages for your Project flows that can automatically segment hundreds of different structures.

On top of that, you have complete control over where the model runs (yes, EU-based teams, the time is now!), when it runs, and how much compute power you have.

## Folder Mode

Gone are the days when project admins and team leads were forced to navigate the plateau of the Data Page. Now you can inject verticality into your Task organization and ascend the mountain of new functionality with [Folder Mode](https://docs.redbrickai.com/project-pages/data-page#folder-mode)!

With Folder Mode enabled, you unlock an entirely new way to navigate your Project’s Data Page. Move up, down, and across the folders of your Task any way you like as you would with any other file management utility.

## Weekly Summary Emails

We received many, many requests for some sort of external reporting to help both teams and individual annotators keep a record of their work.

Enter: weekly reports of your productivity, crafted just for you!

By the way, we’d love to hear about your wish lists for this feature as we continue to improve it... And please reach out to us with your nice-to-haves!

P.S. Yes, you can turn them off, just head to your [Account Settings](https://docs.redbrickai.com/dashboard/account-settings#weekly-summary-emails) to do so.

## Bring Your Own Model

If our [many libraries of Boost models](https://docs.redbrickai.com/dashboard/boost/auto-annotator#boost-models) don’t address your auto-segmentation needs, you can now bring your own to the table! We’ve made it easier than ever before to leverage your existing algorithms and models in your RedBrick AI workflows, so cut down on the pre-processing hassle and reach out to us at [support@redbrickai.com](mailto:support@redbrickai.com) today!

## Annotation Overlays

Reviewers rejoice, because this one’s just for you! With the press of a single button, you can display all of an annotation’s attributes on the current viewport for comparison or a spot check.

We especially recommend using these overlays when evaluating annotator work in the Review Stages of multi-reader flows (such as Manual Merge, _wink wink_).

## Other Improvements

Last but not least, we wanted to bring a few of our more minor changes to light that have been heavily requested. If you’d like to stay up to date with the latest, we encourage bookmarking our [changelog](https://changelog.redbrickai.com/).

- **New field on Teams Page:** The Teams Page will now display a datetime stamp based on each user’s last login (or activity) on the platform. We hope this makes managing your users a bit easier!
    
- **Enhanced Preview Tool:** The Preview Tool was great for spot-checking how an image and/or annotations stored on your local machine will render on RedBrick, and now that limitation has been removed! For any Storage Method you have integrated on RedBrick, you can now just copy and paste a file path to preview any file inside your bucket.
    
- **Global MFA:** RedBrick is now more secure than ever before! All users must now have either Authenticator App or Email MFA enabled for their accounts in order to be able to access the platform.
